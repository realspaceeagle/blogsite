## Professional Snapshot
I help teams build resilient security programs across cloud, AI, and modern application stacks. My work spans penetration testing, DevSecOps, AI security research, and incident response, with a focus on translating fast-changing threat intelligence into practical defensive strategies.

## Focus Areas
- Cloud-native defense for AWS, Azure, and GCP environments
- Secure architecture reviews for AI workloads and ML supply chains
- DevSecOps enablement with policy-as-code and automated testing
- Offensive research to inform threat hunting, purple teaming, and detection engineering
- Security enablement through workshops, community engagement, and long-form writing

## Security Philosophy
- **Defense in depth:** layered controls that reduce blast radius and accelerate recovery
- **Zero trust by default:** continuous verification across identities, services, and data flows
- **Shift-left:** embed security guardrails into design, code, and build pipelines
- **Continuous monitoring:** combine telemetry, automation, and playbooks for real-time response
- **Shared knowledge:** open collaboration to raise the baseline for the wider security community

## Technical Expertise

### Cloud & DevSecOps
- **AWS:** IAM hardening, GuardDuty, Security Hub, Config, CloudTrail analytics
- **Azure:** Sentinel playbooks, Defender for Cloud, Key Vault, Purview integration
- **GCP:** Security Command Center, IAM, Cloud Armor, Binary Authorization
- **Containers & IaC:** Kubernetes RBAC and network policies, Terraform compliance, Jenkins and GitLab CI security gates

### Threat Detection & Response
- SIEM engineering with Splunk, Azure Sentinel, and Elastic Security
- Threat hunting aligned to MITRE ATT&CK, Sigma, and YARA rule development
- Incident response across forensics, malware triage, and timeline reconstruction

### Offensive Security Toolkit
- Reconnaissance with Nmap, Amass, Subfinder, theHarvester, Shodan, Censys
- Web application testing using Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, SQLMap, Gobuster
- Exploitation and post-exploitation with Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, BloodHound
- Cloud and container assessments with Prowler, ScoutSuite, Trivy, Falco, Aqua

### Programming & Automation
- **Python:** security automation, ML-assisted detection, threat tooling
- **Go:** high-performance scanners and cloud security utilities
- **Bash:** system hardening, log triage, infrastructure automation
- **PowerShell:** Active Directory assessments and Windows endpoint defense

### Frameworks & Standards
- Offensive: MITRE ATT&CK, OWASP Testing Guide, PTES
- Defensive: NIST CSF, CIS Controls, ISO 27001/27002
- Compliance: GDPR, SOC 2, PCI DSS, cloud shared responsibility models
