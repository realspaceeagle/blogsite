## The Code Review Paradox

There's a well-known observation in the programming world that perfectly captures the psychology of code reviews:

> "Ask a programmer to review 10 lines of code, he'll find 10 issues. Ask him to do 500 lines and he'll say it looks good."

This humorous statement, originally shared by Giray Ã–zil, reveals a fundamental truth about human psychology and code review effectiveness.

## Why This Happens

### Cognitive Overload
When faced with large amounts of code, reviewers experience cognitive overload. The human brain can only process so much information effectively before attention to detail begins to deteriorate.

### Time Pressure
Large pull requests often come with implicit time pressure. Reviewers feel they need to complete the review quickly, leading to superficial examination rather than thorough analysis.

### False Sense of Complexity
There's a psychological tendency to assume that larger codebases have been more thoroughly tested by the author, leading to misplaced confidence.

## Best Practices for Effective Code Reviews

### Keep Reviews Small
- Aim for **200-400 lines maximum** per review
- Break large features into smaller, logical chunks
- Submit incremental improvements rather than massive overhauls

### Focus on High-Impact Areas
- Prioritize security-sensitive code
- Pay special attention to error handling
- Review business logic thoroughly

### Use Checklists
Create standardized checklists covering:
- Code style and formatting
- Error handling
- Performance considerations
- Security vulnerabilities
- Test coverage

## The Solution: Small, Frequent Reviews

The most effective code reviews are:
- **Small in scope** (under 400 lines)
- **Focused on specific functionality**
- **Reviewed within 24-48 hours**
- **Accompanied by clear descriptions**

## Conclusion

Understanding the psychology behind code reviews helps us structure them more effectively. By keeping reviews small and manageable, we ensure that reviewers can maintain the attention to detail necessary to catch issues and maintain code quality.

Remember: It's better to have multiple small, thorough reviews than one large, superficial one.
